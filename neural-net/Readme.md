## What is a Neural Network(NN)?

A NN is a simple mathematical function which maps inputs to a desired output along with some weights 

Neural Networks consist of the following components

    An input layer, x
    An arbitrary amount of hidden layers
    An output layer, ŷ
    A set of weights and biases between each layer, W and b
    A choice of activation function for each hidden layer, σ. 
    
    In this tutorial, we’ll use a Sigmoid activation function.

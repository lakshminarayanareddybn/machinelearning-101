## What is a Neural Network(NN)?

A NN is a simple mathematical function which maps inputs to a desired output along with some weights.

OR

It is basically an algorithm that learns on the pairs of examples input and output data, detects some kind of patterns, and predicts the output based on an unseen input data. 

Neural Networks consist of the following components

    An input layer, x
    An arbitrary amount of hidden layers
    An output layer, ŷ
    A set of weights and biases between each layer, W and b
    A choice of activation function for each hidden layer, σ. 
    
    In this tutorial, we’ll use a Sigmoid activation function.
